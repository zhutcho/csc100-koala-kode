Hi all,

Just thought it would be a good idea to write out some of the things we need to get done. 
Feel free to add stuff or elaborate further on points.


* Setup pulling the data from the database.
* Separate anything functional from the gui parts.
* Create the ReportPage gui.
* Make the gui pages look appealing.
* Code the pdf creation part.
* Create some tests.
* Add a thirdparty folder for external libraries?
* Write the README.md file.
